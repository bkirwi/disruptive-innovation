# Notes

We have a pull-based api (currently, handler)
and a push-based one (currently, producer).
Pull-based lets you applicative,
push-based lets you flatmap etc.
Maybe nobody needs to flatmap?
Could just do an explicit handler-flavoured API.
Might be smart!
Advantage of explicit sink: more flexible, easier to name.
Advantage of more flowing api: easier to use.
